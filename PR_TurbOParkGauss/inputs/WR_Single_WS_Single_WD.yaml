# The height to consider the "center" of the vertical wind speed profile
# due to shear. With a shear exponent not 1, the wind speed at this height
# will be the value given in ``wind_speeds``. Above and below this height,
# the wind speed will change according to the shear profile; see
# :py:meth:`.FlowField.initialize_velocity_field`.
# For farms consisting of one wind turbine type, use ``reference_wind_height: -1``
# to use the hub height of the wind turbine definition. For multiple wind turbine
# types, the reference wind height must be given explicitly.

# The conditions that are specified for use with the multi-dimensional Cp/Ct capbility.

# to use. These conditions are only used with the ``multidim_cp_ct`` velocity deficit model.
