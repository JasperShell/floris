# Listing of turbine types for placement at the x and y coordinates given above.
# The list length must be 1 or the same as ``layout_x`` and ``layout_y``. If it is a
# single value, all turbines are of the same type. Otherwise, the turbine type
# is mapped to the location at the same index in ``layout_x`` and ``layout_y``.
# The types can be either a name included in the turbine_library or
# a full definition of a wind turbine directly.
